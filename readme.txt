This package contains Max/MSP objects for manipulating Launchpad LEDs, as well
as getting input (i.e. button presses) from the Launchpad. Apart from this
document, the following files are included:

phi.lpad.in.maxpat - object for getting input from the Launchpad.
phi.lpad.out.maxpat - object to manipulating Launchpad LEDs.
phi.lpad.in.maxhelp.maxpat - help file for phi.lpad.in.
phi.lpad.out.maxhelp.maxpat - help file for phi.lpad.out.
duty_cycles.txt - list of duty cycle (brightness) values for the LEDs.

To install, just put these files somewhere in your Max/MSP search path. Check
out the Max help files for the object for information on using them.
