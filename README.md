phi-launchpad-max
=================

Max abstractions for working with the Novation Launchpad. Basically these wrap the functions described in the Launchpad Programmer’s Reference in easy-to-use messages so that you don’t have to worry about the Launchpad’s MIDI protocol in order to manipulate LEDs and get input. You can set LEDs, control double buffering and flashing, perform rapid LED updates, change overall brightness, and get input from the Launchpad.
